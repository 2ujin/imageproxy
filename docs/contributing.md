# Contributing to imageproxy

## Types of contributions

Simple bug fixes for existing functionality are always welcome.  In many cases,
it may be helpful to include a reproducible sample case that demonstrates the
bug being fixed.

For new functionality, it's general best to open an issue first to discuss it.

## Contributor License Agreement

Even though this is effectively a personal project of mine, it is still governed
by Google's Contributor License Agreement because of my employment there.  You
(or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution; the CLA simply
gives permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the
project.  Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current
agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different Google project), you probably don't need to do
it again.
